IDGen

Overview:
---------
IDGen, provide automatically generated IDs based on a selector which is supplied by the caller using rest url, and stores the data into files.

Data storage for the IDGen takes place in text files,
1) IDGen_Tracker.txt : Stores the selector value and its generated ID.
2) IDGen_Selector.txt : Stores the caller and selector values if the tracker file does not have its record.
3) IDGen_Log.txt : Stores the Log details.

Requirement:
------------
1) getID:
For every rest url request, increment the selector's id and returns it in json format. 

2) ListIDSelector: 
ListIDSelector will return all callers and selectors from the “IDGen_Selector.txt” file, and return it in json format.

Implementation:
---------------
Controller class has two restful request. 

1) getID:
For every rest url request, increment the selector's id and returns it in json format. 

The rest url will contain caller and selector, for every url request the selector values is been checked with the “IDGen_Tracker.txt” file selector value, and if the file contains the selector value the id of selector in “IDGen_Tracker.txt” file will increment by 1.

If the selector value is not in “IDGen_Tracker.txt” file, then the selector adds the caller value and selector value to the “IDGen_Selector.txt” file. And add selector value with id 1 in “IDGen_Tracker.txt” file.

“IDGen_Log.txt” file will save the time date and the values of caller and selector with the id.

2) ListIDSelector : 
ListIDSelector will return all callers and selectors from the “IDGen_Selector.txt” file, and return it in json format.

When the request comes for ListIDSelector,  the “IDGen_Selector.txt” file is read, and return the data as key and value pair of selector value and its caller value in json format.
