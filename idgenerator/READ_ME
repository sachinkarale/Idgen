This project is all about generating unique id for every request from rest url,
and keeps the record of the selector and its auto generated Id for every request.

For every new selector its been saved to the selector file.

The selector can have 3 special characters (:-_),
rest all special characters gives us the error message.
Numbers are allowed with the selector.
